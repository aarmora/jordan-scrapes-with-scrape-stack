# Jordan Scrapes With scrapestack

This package has some sample code using [scrapestack](https://scrapestack.com/).

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run `npm i`. 

You'll need to get an API key (from [scrapestack](https://scrapestack.com)) and rename `src/sample-config.ts` file to `src/config.ts` and place your api key there.

There are commented out portions of the code that test with scrapestack using both axios and puppeteer. Just comment the portions you wish to use in before running.

After that, you just need to run `npm start`.
